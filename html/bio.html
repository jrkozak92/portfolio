        I graduated from <a href="https://www.trinity.edu/" class="content-links">Trinity University</a>, class of '14, with my B.S in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing. After graduating with such a broadly scoped degree, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. So, I bounced from managing a <a href="https://www.jetspizza.com/stores/texas/tomball/24225-kuykendahl-drive/" class="content-links">restaurant</a> to office management and event assistance with a <a href="https://www.airrosti.com/" class="content-links">physical rehabilitation clinic</a> to digital marketing in <a href="http://containmentsolutions.com/" class="content-links">downstream Oil & Gas</a> to <a href="https://www.3-gig.com/" class="content-links">Management/Software Consulting</a> in upstream Oil & Gas to starting <a href="http://jroneaerial.com/" class="content-links">my own business</a> as a sUAS (read 'Drones') operator doing freelance/contract insurance inspections, marketing asset capture and production, data collection, and custom creative work.

        That said, my work (at least the parts of it that I enjoyed the most) was continually pointing me toward technology and software development, which lead me here. I am currently taking part in a Remote Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp to formalize and modernize the knowledge I already have and to learn everything I can about software development with the goal of starting an actual career (as opposed to changing industries every few years) as a Software Engineer.

        In my down-time, which is in short supply nowadays, I enjoy playing with my dogs, Ella and Buddy, flying FPV drones, speedsolving Rubik's Cubes of varying sizes, playing video games, international travel (if I'm really lucky), and generally spending time with my wife. I aspire to single-handedly write and release a few applications into the world, and to become confidently conversational in Spanish. Which of those will come first is very hard to say at the moment, I think I'm within a year's effort of being able to do either.
